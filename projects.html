                <h2>Project 1: Stakeholder Register/Report for Intro to Project Management</h2>
                    <p>In this group project, I was required to select a topic and fill out a stakeholder register for that topic,
                    as well as write up a couple paragraphs based on said register. In case you do not know, a stakeholder
                    register is a form which lists all stakeholders of a given project, then lists various attributes of each
                    stakeholder such as their interest level, level of influence over the project, and how often they should
                    be contacted to receive updates on the project. The report required me and my group members to select one
                    stakeholder out of the eight total stakeholders, then write three paragraphs explaining why the various
                    register fields were filled out in the way that they were.

                <h2>Project 2: Student Grading System for Object Oriented Programming for IT</h2>
                    <p>In this group project, I was required to select a topic from a list(or choose another and clear it with the instructor),
                    then create a python program following that topic, while also meeting a variety of other criteria(these criteria would 
                    apply regardless of topic and mainly involved demonstrating certain programming concepts or techniques). My group chose
                    to create a student grading system, which allowed users to enter grades for different students and different courses,
                    then generated summaries/averages in text form as well as in graph form(bar graphs were used).

                <h2>Project 3: Assembly Demo/Report for Computer Architecture</h2>
                    <p>In this group project, I was required to create a report on different types of assembly architectures, as well
                    write a couple demo programs. The report included an overview of each different architecture's features, comparing
                    and contrasting them, as well as describing the history of their development.

                <h2>Project 4: Elevator Pitch for Intro to Entrepreneurship</h2>
                    <p>In this solo project, I was required to create an elevator pitch on the Wii U gaming console(the product was up to the
                    student to choose). This elevator pitch involved creating a short, 60-second oral presentation(with an accompanying slideshow)
                    which attempted to convince the listener of all the merits and advantages of the selected product. This presentation was recorded
                    by me, then submitted on canvas- it was not a live presentation.
