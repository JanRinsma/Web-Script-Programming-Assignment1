VIEWPORT DIMENSIONS EXPLANATION:
When deciding what dimensions to use for each viewport(phone/tablet/laptop+desktop), 
I referred to Week3.pdf, which deals with responsive design and media queries. There, on page 9 of 15, it lists the typical dimensions for phones, tablets, and laptops which are as follows:
    -Smartphones are usually no more than 480px wide
    -Tablets are usually between 481px and 960px wide
    -Laptops/Desktops are usually 960px wide or wider

Furthermore, since I prioritized using percentage-based measures almost exclusively(aside from border measurements, perhaps), the css files for different
viewports are very similar. The only differences were a resizing of the main heading of each page as the viewport shrinks to provide text extending past
its border, and increased contrast in tablet/phone views.

COLOUR SCHEME EXPLANATION:
The scheme I created includes six colours, defined by the following hex codes:
    -#C9EBC0
    -#AB7DA1
    -#EBC0E1
    -#6C9662
    -#6B335F
    -#1D4014

The scheme contains three colours which have a cooler hue, and three colours which are 
more earthy. I have included an image of my colour scheme for reference purposes.

GRADIENT EXPLANATION:
I used a linear gradient on my home page, and an angle gradient on my about page.
    Linear Gradient: linear-gradient(to bottom, #6b335f, #ab7da1, #ebc0e1);
    Angle Gradient: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #1d4014, #6c9662, #c9ebc0);

TESTING AND VALIDATION:
To avoid cluttering the screen with an excess of screenshots, the screenshots of my testing/validation results will be collected in a separate folder. Each screenshot will be named according to what it is testing(html testing.png, css testing 3.png, accessibility2.png, etc.). For the spell checking, I pasted all my code in a google doc and used the spell check tool. This document will also be included in the folder. The folder will be named "Testing and
Validation".

IMPORTANT NOTES/CREDITS:
I referenced the site https://www.w3schools.com/, as well as the MDN site(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), multiple times throughout my project.
While I referenced both these sites for refreshers on concepts or general syntax, the only lines I actually copied were the two metadata tags my site uses, found here(https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp). In the first code example titled "Describe metadata 
within an HTML document", I used the first and last meta tags(the charset and viewport
ones). I also downloaded a font from google fonts, found here(https://fonts.google.com/selection?preview.text=testing%20testing%20testing&preview.size=14&sort=relevance&categoryFilters=Feeling:%2FExpressive%2FBusiness;Serif:%2FSerif%2FModern). I browsed
this(https://fonts.google.com/selection#how-to-use) section of the google fonts site
and found out that the "@font-face" rule could be used to import external fonts, and used
this(https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/atrule_font-face.php) w3schools page for further
usage information/instructions. In order to figure out how to host a site on github,
I referred to the github docs site, specifically, I used the following links:
    -https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site
    -https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site


The OFL.txt file is a licence for the text which, if I understand it correctly, must accompany any use of its font. The "CactusClassicalSerif-Regular.ttf"
file is the font itself.
